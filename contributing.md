Thank you for your interest in, and engagement with this project. We intend to provide this solution for companies and 
developers willing to build great loyalty applications all over the world and would like to encourage you to join us in 
creating the best open source platform for this purpose.

Before you type an issue please check the main 
[readme](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/divante-ltd/pimcore-mysql-object-search/blob/master/readme.md)

Issue reporting guidelines:
* Always define type of issue:
    * Bug report
    * Feature request
* While writing issues, be as specific as possible
* All requests regarding support with implementation or application setup should be sent to us

Here’s how to submit a pull request:
* __Fork the repository__ and clone it locally. Connect your local repository to the original “upstream” repository by adding 
it as a remote repository. Pull in changes from “upstream” often in order to stay up to date so that when you submit your 
pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
* __Create a branch__ for your edits. Use the following branch naming conventions:
    * bugfix/task-title
    * feature/task-name
* __Reference any relevant issues__ or supporting documentation in your PR (ex. “XYZ: 39. Issue title.”).
* __Include screenshots of the before and after__ if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images 
into the body of your pull request.
* __Test your changes!__ Run your changes against any existing tests and create new ones when needed. Make sure your changes 
don’t break the existing project.
* __Contribute in the style of the project__ and follow the 
[code of conduct](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/divante-ltd/pimcore-mysql-object-search/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) and 
[coding standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html)
* __Check build status on Travis.__ It always should be green.
